                    <h3>Digital Arrest</h3>
                    <p>Scammers pose as Police or CBI on video calls, saying you are "arrested" and must stay on camera
                        for hours. <strong>Fact:</strong> Police never arrest anyone over video call.</p>

                    <h3>AI Voice Cloning</h3>
                    <p>You might get a call that sounds 100% like your grandchild crying for help. Scammers use AI to
                        copy their voice. <strong>Tip:</strong> Always call them back on their real number first.</p>

                    <h3>Electricity Bill Trap</h3>
                    <p>An SMS says "Your power will be cut tonight at 9 PM due to unpaid bills." It asks you to call a number. <strong>Reality:</strong> Real bill departments never send personal phone numbers in SMS.</p>

                    <h3>The Fake Bank Call</h3>
                    <p>Claims your ATM card is blocked and asks for an OTP. Real banks will <strong>never</strong> ask for your OTP or PIN over the phone.</p>

                    <p>Someone says a parcel in your name contains "illegal items" and you must pay to clear it. Just hang up—it's a scam to scare you.</p>

                    <p>WhatsApp messages saying you've won ₹25 Lakhs. They ask for a small "processing fee" first. Once you pay, they disappear.</p>
